## 👨‍💻 About Me

I’m Jesús, a biotechnology graduate with a Master’s in Genetic Counselling.  
During my five years in Australia, I worked as a **research assistant in melanoma genetics**, where I gained practical experience in:

- statistical modelling  
- R-based analysis  
- automation of analytical workflows  
- producing publication-ready figures  
- and generating large-scale, personalized reports

My coding experience grew across different areas: **R**, **Python**, **JavaScript**, introductory software engineering, object-oriented programming, and bioinformatics fundamentals. I’ve built automated reporting systems, data pipelines, and visualization tools — some used internally for real research output.

I'm now advancing toward a career that combines **scientific reasoning, data analysis, and modern software development**.
