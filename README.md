## 👨‍💻 About Me

I’m Jesús, a Biotechnology graduate with a Master’s in Genetic Counselling.  
During my five years in Australia, I worked as a **research assistant in melanoma genetics** while studying. I’ve always been deeply drawn to **genetics and genomics**, and while training to become a clinician, I noticed how much I enjoyed the technical side of the field — statistics, scripting, automation, and scientific computing.

Throughout my studies and work, I used **R, Python and JavaScript** for a mix of statistical modelling, data exploration, automation scripting, and producing clean analytical outputs. Over time, that technical path became the direction I wanted to pursue.

Now I’m focusing on developing solid skills in **data science and bioinformatics**, combining my scientific background with modern tools and software development.
