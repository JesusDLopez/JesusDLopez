## 👨‍💻 About Me

I’m Jesús, born in Lanzarote and recently back home after five years in Australia.  
I studied **Biotechnology** and completed a **Master’s in Genetic Counselling**, working as a research assistant in **melanoma genetics**.

During that time, I discovered how transformative programming can be:  
I went from struggling with R and bioinformatics to building small automation tools that became genuinely useful for my research team.

Now I’m fully committing to the path that connects everything I love:  
**genomics, analytics, and modern software development.**
